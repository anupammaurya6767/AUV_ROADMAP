## Tanuj AUV in Simulated Environment

Tanuj AUV is our autonomous underwater vehicle designed and developed for simulated environments. It leverages the power of ROS 2 Humble, OpenCV in C++, and YOLO for object detection to navigate, explore, and perform tasks in underwater scenarios.

The AUV is equipped with various sensors and a robust control system to ensure efficient underwater operations.

## ROS 2 Humble

ROS 2 Humble is the foundation of our AUV project. It provides the middleware and tools necessary for controlling the AUV, handling sensor data, and facilitating communication between components. ROS 2 Humble also allows us to create a modular and scalable software architecture for our AUV.

## OpenCV in C++

OpenCV in C++ plays a critical role in our AUV's computer vision capabilities. It helps process sensor data, perform image analysis, and enhance our AUV's perception of the underwater environment. OpenCV is essential for tasks such as object detection, image stabilization, and feature extraction.

## YOLO for Object Detection

We use YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection in our AUV project. YOLO enhances the AUV's ability to detect and recognize objects in the underwater environment, making it capable of performing complex tasks and avoiding collisions.

## Collaboration

We welcome collaboration and contributions from the community. If you have suggestions, encounter issues, or would like to contribute to our project, please feel free to:

- [Create an Issue](link-to-issues) to report problems or propose enhancements.
- Make a Pull Request (PR) to contribute code, fixes, or improvements.

We appreciate your interest in our project and look forward to working together to make our AUV project even better.
